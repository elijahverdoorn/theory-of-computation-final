# Theory of Computation Final Project

Essentially a clone of JFLAP, this web application allows the user to input a turing machine, represented as a graph, then simulate the execution of that machine on a user-defined string.

## Building

To build this project, download the source and install the node modules. Serve the directory (I used python's `SimpleHTTPServer`) and open `index.html`. Verified to work in Chrome, but it should work in any browser that supports the canvas renderer.

## Hosted Use

The project is hosted here on GitHub through GitHub pages. See this url https://elijahverdoorn.github.io/theory-of-computation-final/ to use.
